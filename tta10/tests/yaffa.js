// 5. Write a function called 'calculateTax' that takes the total amount
// of a purchase and a tax rate as parameters, and returns the calculated tax.
// Call the function with a purchase amount of $100 and a tax rate of 8%,
// and log the result to the console.

// 6. Write two functions: 'doubleNumber' that takes a number
// and returns the double of that number, and 'squareAndDouble' that
// calls 'doubleNumber' and squares the result. Call 'squareAndDouble'
// with the initial number 4 and log the result to the console.
